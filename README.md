## Description

The Challenge for Module #19 asked us work with code given to us for an application to make it a Progressive Web App that is able to be installed and used on a local device even when the device is offline. When the device is offline, the app stores any data modified, created, or deleted, and updates itself when the device comes back online.

## Usage

To use this app, navigate to the deployed site. App can be used directly online through the browser. To install the app, click Install. This will download a copy of the app to your machine, and you can use it when offline. 


## Challenges

There was a lot of time debugging this project, which took almost as much time as writing the code itself. A large amount of time was spent trying to figure out if the Install button worked-- I installed the app on my local machine and, even thought I uninstalled/deleted, the app would not re-install. My tutor described this as a rare instance of "it doesn't work on my machine, but it works when deployed", when the problem is usually the opposite.


## Credits

Tutor Dru Sanchez provided guidance. TA Negin Namiranian helped with debugging in office hours.
